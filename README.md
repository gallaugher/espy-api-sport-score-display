Modified version of the excellent LED Sports Tracker by Liz Clark (BlitzCityDIY) that you can find on learn.adafruit.com. Thanks, Liz - you're awesome!

I've modified this to use two 64 x 64 LEDs, and have made a few more changes to logos, which I detail in a build video you'll find at:
https://YouTube.com/@BuildWithProfG.

Hardware:
- Matrix Portal S3 board: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5778
  You can also build this with a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, but you'll need use 16 wires to connect to a HUB75 display.
  A tutorial on HUB75 wiring for the Raspberry Pi Pico is here: https://youtu.be/vM3-0qyjfh8?si=D18yiyWymQA94IvY 
- Two 64 x 64 HUB75 standard LED Matrix Panels like these ones: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4732
  Any HUB75 panels of the same size should do. Pitch doesn't matter.
  These alsoinclude the barrel jack terminal block, split power cables, and the ribbon band to connect two displays together.
- USB-C cable to connect the Matrix Portal S3 to your computer, or it's own power supply
- Any standard phone-style USB-C plug-in power supply
- a barrel-plug power supply, at least 5v4a - I use 5v10a for mine.

I also connected the two displays with 1/2" foam core board that I cut & attached using heavy duty velcro tape.

Below is an example of the wiring. More in the video lesson on the channel link, above
